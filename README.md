Project 12: Model for quickly predicting vehicle values. <br>
**Task:** Create a machine learning model to quickly be able to predict a vehicle's prices based off of historical vehicle sales data. <br>
**Skills:** Analyze large set of categorical and numerical data for vehicles to find patterns and trends that correlate to sales price. Use those features to buil models for predicting vehicle values quickly. Trained and evaluated serveral regressor models with hyperparameter tuning. Analyzed learning and prediction times for each model. Used Optuna and Cat Boost for parameter tuning. LightGBM model provided best balance between training time, prediction time, and accuracy.
